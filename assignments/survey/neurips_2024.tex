\section{Introduction}
The year 2023 marked a significant turning point in the history of artificial intelligence development. With the release of milestone large models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 3, and Google's Gemini 2, artificial intelligence transitioned from laboratory research to a new era of large-scale commercial applications. These models not only achieved breakthroughs in parameter scale—leaping from hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters—but also demonstrated unprecedented potential in multimodal understanding, reasoning capabilities, and application adaptability.

According to the "LLM Statistics 2025" report published by SpringsApps, over 750 million applications worldwide have integrated large language model technology, with market size surging from \$13 billion in 2023 to \$35 billion in 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate of 65\%[@SpringsApps2025]. This explosive growth is driven by the deep convergence of technological maturity and commercial demand: enterprises' urgent need for intelligent transformation, the improvement of cloud computing infrastructure, and the flourishing development of open-source ecosystems have collectively driven the comprehensive adoption of large model applications.

However, the commercialization process of large models has not been smooth sailing. From a technical perspective, issues such as model hallucinations, computational costs, and inference latency still constrain application effectiveness; from a social perspective, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and regulatory compliance are becoming increasingly prominent. How to find a balance between technological innovation and risk control has become a core issue of common concern for both industry and academia.

This survey focuses on the critical period from 2023 to 2025, systematically reviewing the technological evolution and commercial practices of large models in four core application dimensions: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as the foundational architecture for knowledge-intensive applications, multimodal agents as a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, code assistance as a typical representative of developer productivity tools, and vertical industry solutions as an important direction for specialized applications. Through in-depth analysis of benchmark cases such as Notion AI, GitHub Copilot, and BloombergGPT, this paper aims to provide comprehensive and deep technical insights and development trend predictions for researchers and practitioners.

\subsection{Survey Scope and Methodology}
This subsection first explains the literature time range, retrieval database sources, and keyword strategies covered in this paper, then introduces the literature management and statistical tools used, and clarifies the repeatability and transparency of the research process.

Through systematic retrieval of papers published in major academic databases such as arXiv, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library from May 2023 to May 2025, supplemented by Gartner and McKinsey industry reports and enterprise white papers, this paper has compiled over 200 academic papers and 30 industry reports. Search keywords include "RAG survey 2025," "Agent Frameworks," and "Edge LLM," with literature managed through Zotero and structured statistics of paper attributes through Excel and Notion, ensuring the repeatability and transparency of the research process.

Through the above methodology, this paper not only achieved comprehensive coverage of key literature but also provided a solid data foundation for subsequent RAG annual growth trend charts and various application scenario statistics, thereby enhancing the academic rigor and operability of the survey. 

\section{Technical Evolution Review (2023–2025)}
During 2023-2025, large language model technology underwent a critical transformation from "capability validation" to "scaled application." The technical evolution during this period exhibited three distinctive characteristics: diversified innovation in model architectures, significant improvement in inference efficiency, and comprehensive prosperity of application ecosystems.

\subsection{Model Architecture Innovation and Performance Breakthroughs}
At the end of 2023, OpenAI's GPT-4o[@OpenAI2023] achieved native multimodal processing of text, image, and audio for the first time, elevating multimodal understanding capabilities to new heights. The model processed different modal data through a unified Transformer architecture, avoiding information loss problems in traditional multimodal systems, with visual question-answering accuracy improving by 23\% compared to GPT-4.

In 2024, Anthropic's Claude 3 series[@Anthropic2024] achieved major breakthroughs in safety and controllability. Through Constitutional AI training methods, Claude 3 significantly reduced the probability of harmful outputs while maintaining strong capabilities, outperforming all mainstream models of the same period in safety evaluations. Among them, Claude 3 Opus even surpassed human expert levels in complex reasoning tasks.

In the same year, Google's Gemini 2[@Google2024] demonstrated the enormous potential of end-to-end multimodal training. The model integrated text, image, audio, video, and other multimodal data from the early stages of training, achieving true native multimodal understanding. In high-difficulty tasks such as scientific reasoning and mathematical proofs, Gemini 2's performance improved by over 40\% compared to previous generation models.

In 2025, the open-source community reached an important milestone with the release of Mixtral 8x22B[@Mixtral2025]. This Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture model, with 176 billion parameters, achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models in multiple benchmark tests, injecting strong momentum into the open-source large model ecosystem.

\subsection{Architecture Optimization and Efficiency Enhancement}
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture gained widespread application during this period[@Fedus2021]. MoE significantly reduced computational overhead while maintaining model capacity through dynamic routing mechanisms. Representative works such as Switch Transformer proved that MoE architecture could achieve 4-7 times performance improvement under the same computational budget, laying the foundation for practical deployment of large-scale models.

Breakthrough advances in quantization technology significantly reduced model deployment costs[@Dettmers2023]. INT4 and FP8 quantization methods reduced storage requirements by 60-70\% while maintaining model performance, and improved inference speed by 2-3 times. Particularly, Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) technology maintained near-original precision performance even under extremely low-bit quantization by protecting important weight channels.

Optimization of inference frameworks provided critical support for large-scale deployment. vLLM, through the PagedAttention mechanism[@Zhang2023vLLM], improved GPU memory utilization from the traditional 20-40\% to over 90\%, enabling a single card to serve 5-10 times more concurrent users. Emerging frameworks like SGLang further introduced RadixAttention and zero-overhead batch scheduling technologies, achieving significant performance improvements in complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios.

\subsection{Ecosystem Maturation and Standardization}
The open-source ecosystem experienced explosive development during this period. Hugging Face Transformers library downloads grew from 50 million in 2023 to 250 million in 2025, becoming the de facto standard for large model application development. The emergence of application frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex greatly lowered the technical barriers for large model integration, enabling small and medium enterprises to quickly build intelligent applications.

Standardization of API services promoted healthy development of the industrial ecosystem. Mainstream service providers like OpenAI API and Anthropic Claude API established relatively unified interface specifications, providing good migration guarantees for application developers. Meanwhile, the popularization of open-source inference services like Ollama and LM Studio provided feasible solutions for enterprise private deployment.

The improvement of evaluation systems provided scientific guidance for technological progress. From traditional benchmarks like MMLU and HellaSwag, to comprehensive evaluation frameworks like BigBench and HELM, and then to specialized evaluation sets for specific application scenarios, multi-tier evaluation systems provided reliable evidence for objective comparison of model capabilities.

The technical evolution during this period laid a solid foundation for subsequent large-scale commercial applications and pointed the direction for technological development after 2025.

These trends not only reflect the internal logic of technological development but also embody the evolution direction of market demand, providing important guidance for future technology R\&D and product innovation. 

\section{Key Supporting Technologies}
The implementation of large model applications relies on multiple foundational technologies, including retrieval augmentation, quantization, and multimodal fusion.

\subsection{Retrieval Augmentation and RAG}
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology supplements knowledge through external retrieval databases, addressing the memory limitations of pure generative models. Over 1,200 related papers were published in 2024[@Medium2024], with typical works such as REALM and RETRO demonstrating the effectiveness of vector retrieval and dynamic context concatenation.

\subsubsection{RAG Technology Evolution and Classification}
Traditional RAG systems face challenges such as unstable retrieval quality, limited contextual understanding, and hallucination problems[@EdenAI2025]. To address these issues, the research community has proposed various advanced RAG variants:

\textbf{Long RAG} significantly improves context preservation capabilities by processing longer retrieval units (such as document paragraphs or complete documents) rather than traditional small text chunks. This method extends retrieval units from an average of 100 words to complete paragraphs, reducing context fragmentation and performing excellently in scenarios requiring deep understanding such as legal document analysis and academic paper summarization[@EdenAI2025].

\textbf{Self-RAG} introduces self-reflection mechanisms to dynamically decide when to retrieve information and evaluate the relevance of retrieved content. Through reflection tokens (such as ISREL for relevance assessment and ISSUP for evidence support assessment), the model can self-critique and iteratively improve output quality, significantly outperforming traditional RAG in open-domain question answering tasks like TriviaQA[@Wu2023].

\textbf{Corrective RAG (CRAG)} employs lightweight retrieval evaluators to identify and correct inaccurate or ambiguous retrieval results. When retrieval content is determined to be incorrect or ambiguous, the system triggers large-scale web search to obtain more reliable information and filters redundant information through decomposition-recomposition algorithms[@Chen2024].

\textbf{Adaptive RAG} dynamically adjusts retrieval strategies based on query complexity. Simple queries are directly processed by language models, while complex queries initiate multi-step retrieval processes, achieving optimized allocation of computational resources[@Jeong2024].

\subsubsection{Vector Databases and Retrieval Optimization}
The core of modern RAG systems is efficient vector retrieval mechanisms. Vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant achieve semantic retrieval through Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, supporting multiple similarity measures including cosine similarity and Euclidean distance[@ObjectBox2024].

Latest research shows that adaptive vector index partitioning schemes can significantly reduce RAG pipeline latency. VectorLiteRAG leverages the skewness in cluster access within vector databases (a few clusters are frequently queried) to dynamically allocate the minimum number of vector indices to GPU HBM, achieving 2x improvement in vector search response speed[@Kim2025].

Context-guided dynamic retrieval further optimizes generation quality. Through multi-layer perceptual retrieval vector construction strategies and differentiable document matching paths, the system enables end-to-end joint training, significantly improving BLEU and ROUGE-L scores on the Natural Questions dataset[@He2025].

\subsection{Multimodal Fusion}
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) introduce parallel encoding mechanisms for images and text, enabling cross-modal information interaction. Architectures such as Meta's Imagebind and Google's Pathways have promoted the fusion of vision, speech, and text[@AIMultiple2025].

\subsubsection{Multimodal Fusion Strategies}
Modern VLMs employ various fusion strategies to optimize cross-modal understanding capabilities[@Sassarini2025]:

\textbf{Early Fusion} merges different modal data at the initial processing stage. Models like Llama4 and Gemini adopt token-based early fusion strategies, processing text and visual tokens as a single sequence. The Chameleon model demonstrates the effectiveness of mixed-modal early fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image description tasks[@ChameleonTeam2024].

\textbf{Intermediate Fusion} performs modal interaction at intermediate layers. BLIP-2 uses a lightweight query transformer (Q-Former) to bridge visual encoders and language models, while GPT-4V allows text and image features to interact at intermediate layers, achieving complex visual reasoning capabilities[@Sassarini2025].

\textbf{Late Fusion} processes each modality independently before merging final outputs. LLaVA combines pre-trained visual models (CLIP) with large language models, with CLIP processing images and text separately through dual encoders before aligning in a shared embedding space[@Sassarini2025].

\textbf{Hybrid Fusion} strategically combines multiple fusion methods based on data characteristics and task requirements. QwenVL and PaliGemma adopt different fusion strategies for different data type combinations, performing excellently in complex reasoning tasks[@Sassarini2025].

\subsubsection{Visual Feature Fusion Optimization}
Latest research on multi-layer visual feature fusion shows that combining visual features from different stages can improve generalization capabilities, but additional features from the same stage typically lead to performance degradation. Direct fusion of multi-layer visual features at the input stage produces better and more stable performance across various configurations[@Lin2025].

The FUSION model proposes a fully visual-language alignment and integration paradigm, achieving pixel-level integration through text-guided unified visual encoding, with context-aware recursive alignment decoding recursively aggregating visual features during the decoding process, significantly outperforming existing methods using only 630 visual tokens[@Liu2025].

\subsection{Inference Deployment and Optimization}
High-performance inference engines such as vLLM and SGLang improve throughput and concurrency performance through asynchronous scheduling and distributed parallelism[@Zhang2023vLLM]; quantization techniques (INT4/FP8) can reduce model storage by 70\% with minimal precision loss[@Dettmers2023].

\subsubsection{Inference Framework Performance Comparison}
Modern LLM inference frameworks perform differently across various scenarios[@Hyperbolic2025]:

\textbf{vLLM} achieves high-throughput inference through PagedAttention mechanisms and continuous batching. PagedAttention treats attention key-value cache as a virtual memory system, eliminating 60-80\% memory waste in traditional implementations, achieving up to 24x higher throughput than standard HuggingFace Transformers in benchmark tests[@Hyperbolic2025].

\textbf{SGLang} introduces RadixAttention technology for automatic KV cache reuse, achieving up to 5x higher throughput than existing systems in complex multi-call workloads. Its zero-overhead batch scheduler achieves 1.1x throughput improvement by overlapping CPU scheduling with GPU computation[@LMSYS2024].

\textbf{Ollama} focuses on ease of use for local deployment, supporting multi-model services and cross-platform compatibility, but has limited performance in high-concurrency scenarios. Its advantage lies in the convenience of model management and low entry barriers[@Hyperbolic2025].

\textbf{LLaMA.cpp Server} provides extreme lightweight and portability, supporting CPU inference and various hardware acceleration, suitable for edge devices and resource-constrained environments[@Hyperbolic2025].

\subsubsection{Quantization Technology Progress}
Quantization technology achieves significant performance improvements and memory savings by reducing model precision[@Olafenwa2024]:

\textbf{Weight Quantization} compresses model weights from 16-bit floating point to 4-bit or 8-bit integers. AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) achieves up to 1.7x acceleration compared to GPTQ with less than 1\% accuracy loss[@TensorFuse2025].

\textbf{Dynamic Quantization} dynamically quantizes activation values during inference. FP8 dynamic quantization provides balanced acceleration while maintaining high precision, particularly suitable for Hopper architecture GPUs[@PyTorch2025].

\textbf{Mixed Precision Inference} combines computations of different precisions. Triton kernel libraries like GemLite support multiple activation data types (fp16, int8, fp8) and packing formats, achieving high performance across hardware through automatic tuning[@PyTorch2025].

The latest end-to-end quantized inference solutions integrate GemLite kernels, TorchAO quantization library, and SGLang inference framework, achieving 1.14x to 1.95x acceleration with INT4 weight quantization and 1.10x to 1.28x acceleration with FP8 dynamic quantization on the Llama 3.1-8B model[@PyTorch2025].

\subsubsection{Distributed Inference Optimization}
Tensor Parallelism achieves model parallelism by sharding large matrices across multiple devices. PyTorch's DTensor implements automated shard management and communication coordination, supporting both column-wise and row-wise sharding modes[@PyTorch2025].

Cache-aware load balancers achieve up to 1.9x throughput improvement and 3.8x cache hit rate improvement by predicting prefix KV cache hit rates to select optimal worker nodes[@LMSYS2024].

Data parallel attention mechanisms are optimized for models with single KV heads like DeepSeek, significantly reducing KV cache usage by adopting data parallelism in attention components, achieving 1.9x decoding throughput improvement[@LMSYS2024]. 

\section{Challenges and Risks}
Large models, while bringing tremendous value, also face multi-dimensional challenges and risks that require systematic response strategies.

\subsection{Hallucination and Accuracy Issues}
The hallucination phenomenon in large models is one of the most prominent technical challenges currently. According to latest research, even the most advanced models like GPT-4 have significant hallucination problems, with error rates reaching 15-30\% in certain tasks[@Shi2024].

\subsubsection{Hallucination Generation Mechanisms and Classification}
The fundamental cause of hallucination phenomena lies in the statistical learning nature of models. Large models generate text by learning statistical patterns in training data, rather than truly understanding the factuality of content[@Shi2024]. Research shows that hallucinations can be classified into the following categories:

\textbf{Factual Hallucinations}: Models generate information that contradicts objective facts, such as incorrect historical events, false statistical data, or non-existent character relationships. This type of hallucination is particularly prominent in knowledge-intensive tasks.

\textbf{Logical Hallucinations}: Models exhibit logical errors during reasoning processes, leading to conclusions that don't align with premises. This phenomenon is relatively common in complex reasoning tasks.

\textbf{Consistency Hallucinations}: Models generate mutually contradictory information within the same conversation or document, reflecting the model's lack of global consistency maintenance capability.

\subsubsection{Hallucination Detection and Mitigation Strategies}
The research community has proposed various detection and mitigation methods for hallucination problems:

\textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)} significantly reduces factual errors by verifying and supplementing model outputs through external knowledge bases. Latest RAG systems combine real-time search and multi-source verification, reducing error rates by 40-60\% in factual tasks[@Shi2024].

\textbf{Self-Consistency Checking} has models generate multiple answers to the same question and identifies potential errors through consistency analysis. This method performs particularly well in mathematical reasoning tasks.

\textbf{Uncertainty Quantification} identifies high-risk answers by analyzing confidence distributions of model outputs. Research shows that uncertainty estimation combining temperature sampling and multiple inferences can effectively identify hallucinated content.

\subsection{Privacy and Security Risks}
Large models face diversified and complex privacy security risks, involving multiple levels including training data leakage, model attacks, and malicious use[@Chen2025].

\subsubsection{Privacy Leakage Risk Analysis}
According to the latest 2025 survey, large model privacy risks mainly include the following aspects[@Chen2025]:

\textbf{Training Data Extraction Attacks}: Attackers use carefully designed prompts to induce models to output sensitive information from training data. Research finds that even models trained with privacy protection may still leak personally identifiable information (PII), medical records, and other sensitive data.

\textbf{Membership Inference Attacks}: Inferring whether a specific data sample was in the training set by analyzing the model's response patterns to specific inputs. This type of attack is particularly dangerous in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance.

\textbf{Model Inversion Attacks}: Using model output information to reconstruct features of training data, potentially leading to indirect leakage of private information.

\textbf{Attribute Inference Attacks}: Inferring statistical attributes or individual characteristics of training data through model outputs, such as sensitive attributes like age, gender, and geographic location.

\subsubsection{Privacy Protection Technology Development}
To address privacy risks, the research community has developed various protection technologies:

\textbf{Differential Privacy}: Adding noise during training to ensure that the presence of individual data points doesn't significantly affect model outputs. Latest adaptive differential privacy methods minimize performance loss while protecting privacy[@Chen2025].

\textbf{Federated Learning}: Allows multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Emerging secure aggregation protocols and homomorphic encryption technologies further enhance federated learning security.

\textbf{Confidential Computing}: Uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to protect data security during model training and inference. Hardware-level isolation ensures secure processing of sensitive data even in untrusted environments.

\textbf{Data De-identification}: Performs desensitization processing on sensitive information before training, including tokenization, generalization, and suppression techniques. Advanced semantic-preserving de-identification methods maintain data utility while protecting privacy.

\subsection{Bias and Fairness Challenges}
Bias issues in large models have become a core concern in AI ethics, involving fairness considerations across multiple dimensions including gender, race, age, and religion[@Chu2024].

\subsubsection{Bias Sources and Manifestations}
The sources of large model bias are complex and diverse[@Chu2024]:

\textbf{Training Data Bias}: Internet text data naturally contains social biases and stereotypes. For example, gender bias in job descriptions and racial bias in news reports are learned and amplified by models.

\textbf{Annotation Bias}: Subjective biases of annotators during human annotation processes affect model learning. Research finds significant differences in judgments of the same content by annotators from different cultural backgrounds.

\textbf{Algorithmic Bias}: Model architectures and training algorithms themselves may introduce bias. For example, attention mechanisms may overly focus on certain group characteristics, leading to unfair representation learning.

\textbf{Evaluation Bias}: The design of evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets may favor certain groups, masking unfair model performance on other groups.

\subsubsection{Fairness Evaluation and Improvement Methods}
The research community has proposed systematic evaluation and improvement frameworks for bias issues:

\textbf{Multi-dimensional Fairness Evaluation}: Comprehensive evaluation systems covering individual fairness, group fairness, and counterfactual fairness have been developed. Latest evaluation toolkits like FairLens and BiasX can automatically detect multiple types of bias[@Chu2024].

\textbf{Debiasing Training Techniques}: Including adversarial training, reweighting, and data augmentation methods. Adversarial debiasing significantly reduces bias while maintaining model performance by introducing discriminators to identify and eliminate biased representations.

\textbf{Post-processing Correction}: Performing bias correction at the model output stage, such as reordering and threshold adjustment. The advantage of this method is that it doesn't require model retraining and is applicable to deployed systems.

\textbf{Diversity Enhancement}: Reducing bias by increasing diversity and representativeness of training data. Including strategies such as active learning, synthetic data generation, and cross-cultural data collection.

\subsection{Malicious Use and Abuse Risks}
